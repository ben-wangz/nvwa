# 1. Introduction

The project is to create a unified devops system, which called **nvwa**, for companies who need kubernetes cluster based
software platform but lacking of professional operation engineers. **nvwa** should be able to provide services for
installing software into kubernetes cluster or updating them, constructing distributed storages, continuous integration,
continuous deploying, exposing service endpoints and monitoring the whole cluster. In the other hand, it is aimed to
manage the whole kubernetes cluster with less professional knowledge but more efficient by providing layered interfaces.

This document specifies the requirements of the project, presents the designs to implementing the project, records some
important discussions and includes the user manual.

This chapter will introduce the purposes of this document. Then the scopes of this system will be discussed. At last, we
will give an overview of the whole document.
